# local emulator for Google Cloud Functions

this folder consists of node.js & python files

I will refactor them all into node.js files
(because GCF doesn't support python)

`test.sh`
this shell script file does below automatically

- deploy helloWorld
- call helloWorld
- read logs
- clear helloWorld
